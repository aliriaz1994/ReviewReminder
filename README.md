Magento Review Reminder Extension

**Overview**
Review Reminder extension is an excellent solution for your store to increase conversion rate and boost sales. By allowing sending automated notifications Emails to customers who have purchased products from the store, you can save time and get more
reviews from them. The more reviews you get, the more trustworthy the store looks, which is an essential factor for customers to decide to buy products from your store.

**In Review Reminder Extension, merchants have two options to send a Review Email.**
**1- Automatically Send the Review Reminder Email:**
When a particular entry for an order is generated in the review reminder with the status defined in the configuration as below, this order will be moved automatically to the review reminder table. Merchants will be able to view the orders in the Review Reminder grid. Just like in
this case, the orders with the status ‘pending’ will be moved to this grid. In this feature, an automatic review reminder email will be sent to the customer using cron. We can set different configurations for auto-generation of emails e.g. number of emails per cron,
number of days to wait before sending the email, etc.

**2- Manually Sending the Review Reminder Email:**
When a particular entry for an order is generated in the review reminder with the status defined in the configuration as below, this order will be moved automatically to the review reminder table. Merchants will be able to view the orders in the Review Reminder grid. Just like in
In this case, the orders with the status ‘pending’ will be moved to this grid.

**Features**
• Allow sending automated notification Emails to the customers who have purchased products from the store (using cron).
• Allow sending manual notification Emails to the customers who have purchased products from the store (using Mass Action).
• It will share order items (products) and a link in the email. This link will redirect the customer to the product page by clicking the Write Your Own Review button.
